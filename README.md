Pivotal is useful. But it has a weird and complex layout so it is hard to use for day to day stuff. Rubbernecker simplifies it in a Kanban-esque fashion.

It organises things by status, displays simple information about each story, who is working on it, and how long it has been in that state.

##Installation

Clone this repo

``` 
npm install
```

##Â Running
After completing above installation instructions, to run locally without Basic Authentication:

``` 
DEBUG=rubbernecker:* PIVOTAL_API_KEY=your-api-key PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id npm start
```

If you want to try out the stunning Basic Auth (useful for when you don't want everyone getting straight to your story overviews)
``` 
DEBUG=rubbernecker:* PIVOTAL_API_KEY=your-api-key PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id USE_AUTH=true USERNAME=username PASSWORD=password npm start
```

### Deploying
I've been deploying this to cloud foundry so I use the following manifest file:

```
---
applications:
- name: rubbernecker
  command: npm start
  memory: 128M
  disk_quota: 128M
  buildpack: nodejs_buildpack
  env:
    PIVOTAL_API_KEY: API KEY GOES HERE
    PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID: PROJECT ID GOES HERE
    USE_AUTH: true
    USERNAME: sensible username goes here
    PASSWORD: sensible long password goes here
```

### Some Opinions inflicted on you
We work in 2 week iterations so when figuring out days in a particular state we get back only the last two week of story transitions. If we don't find a thing. Feel free to raise an issue to make this configurable. It might add horrible extra work though to deal with pagination if you are working in longer iterations. If you are though; Ask yourself some questions.
